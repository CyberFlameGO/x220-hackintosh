# macOS on the ThinkPad X220

because who can afford a new MacBook nowadays

## Introduction (and warnings!)

This guide specifically has not been tested extensively. This works on my personal X220. YMMV.

A more complete guide can be found at [John McDonnell's page][mcdonnell] dedicated to installing macOS on the X220.

Also, a lot of things don't work: iMessage, FaceTime, Continuity, Handoff, Metal, among others.

## Installing macOS Mojave

### What you'll need:

* A >=16GB USB flash drive
* [dosdude1's macOS Mojave Patcher][dosdude1]
* Install macOS Mojave.app (optional!)
* [John McDonnell's ThinkPad X220 macOS 10.13 Utility and Kext Pack][mcdonnell]

Lol my Wi-Fi card is not supported RIP
